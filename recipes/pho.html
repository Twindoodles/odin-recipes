    <h2>How to make a bowl of pho</h2>
    <p>While traditionally the dish needs to simmer for at least 6 hours, we'll make a version that can be done in just an hour to fit in our busy lives, all while still retaining the rich, savory flavors of pho.</p>
    <p>Recipe is pulled from <a href="https://helenrecipes.com/recipe-39-pho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helen's Kitchen</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-3 kg/ 2-6 lb of beef bones</li>
        <li>800g beef</li>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>fish sauce, salt, sugar, stock powder</li>
        <li>2 knobs of ginger</li>
        <li>3 star anise</li>
        <li>2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>2-3 black cardamom</li>
        <li>1 tsp cloves (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>1 kg dried rice/ pho noodles</li>
        <li>100g spring onion</li>
        <li>fresh herbs (asian basil, sawtooth herbs)</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>500g bean sprouts</li>
        <li>Hoisin sauce, Sriracha (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the beef bones in a large pot filled with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil for 5-10 minutes. Skim off the impurities that rise to the top. Discard the water and rinse the bones thoroughly under running water. Clean the pot. This step is crucial for a clear broth and will save you time when skimming off scum later.</li>
        <li>Return the parboiled and rinsed bones to a large stock pot and fill it with about 5 liters of water. If using the same pot, ensure it is clean before putting the bones back to maintain a clear broth. Add 1 peeled onion, 1 tbsp salt, and 1 tbsp sugar (rock sugar preferred, but caster/brown sugar works too). Bring to a boil and simmer over medium-low heat. Occasionally skim off scum and fat. Do not cover the pot to preserve broth clarity.</li>
        <li>To infuse the Pho aroma, grill the remaining onion, ginger slices, star anise, cinnamon sticks, and black cardamoms directly on an open flame stove until slightly charred on both sides. You can also use an oven. Peel the grilled onion, removing the charred part while keeping the stem intact and onion layers intact. Rinse off any black char bits under warm running water. Wrap the small spices in a large tea/spice bag or cheese cloth and place the bags in the stock pot.</li>
        <li>Depending on the beef cut, cooking time may range from 1-2 hours. Once the meat is cooked, remove it and soak it in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes to prevent drying or discoloration. Drain and thinly slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Also remove the onions from the pot to avoid breaking them and clouding the broth. Continue simmering the broth for a few more hours if time permits. Traditional Pho can even be cooked overnight. Add more water if the broth reduces.</li>
        <li>If cooking the stock for more than 3 hours, add the charred onion and ginger during the last hour to maintain a fresh and enticing aroma. Season the broth to taste with salt, sugar, and stock powder.</li>
        <li>Soak the dried flat rice noodles "banh pho" in water for 5-15 minutes to soften. Blanch a handful of noodles in a long-handle strainer for 10 to 20 seconds, then transfer to a serving bowl. Serve immediately. Alternatively, cook the whole pack of noodles following package instructions. Remove the noodles when they are soft but still slightly chewy (al dente). Rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process, then rinse again with hot water to aid faster drying and prevent clumping. You can also use the same saucepan to blanch the bean sprouts for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>To assemble the dish, place a handful of cooked noodles in one-third of the bowl. Arrange sliced beef on top (cooked or fresh raw beef of choice), and garnish with thinly sliced onion and chopped spring onion. Ladle hot soup over the ingredients to fill the bowl.</li>
        <li>Serve with a platter of herbs and blanched bean sprouts. Squeeze a lime wedge and add hoisin or Sriracha sauce according to personal preference.</li>
